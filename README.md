# mintpy-ext

This repository is meant to share MintPy related code and recipes to the community for advanced users and developers, inspired by the GMTSAR [user-contributions](https://github.com/gmtsar/user-contributions).

The purpose is as follows:
+ Share self-contained code, recipes, packages that are built on top of mintpy
+ Share useful work-in-progress code, which is fully functional, but maybe not clean enough in the implementation for a pull request in the mintpy yet.

We will help with the code organization of this repository (and ask for auxliary info for basic maintainence), and approve your pull request only if you did not modify other people's contributions. No actual code review will be done. All contributors are responsible for their own code or packages.
